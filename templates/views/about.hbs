      <p>Hello my name is Daniel Antonio. As I'm writing this, the COVID-19 (aka "The Carona") virus
      epidemic is getting worse with each passing day. I am new to the Web Development world and wanted to practice
      APIs and thus, this Web-App was born. I know this app isn't the flashiest nor the most informative but it does lay down the
      facts. If you want more information on the App and how it works, check the "Help" page for more info. Have an awesome day and please stay safe!</p>
